  QuaranTeam is India's first Web Application that will take Group Video watching experience to the next level.

  The features of Audio Channeling as per seating arrangement, Real and immersive live experience with live webcam feed
and feature of Video filters with an intuitive and simplistic UI which will be versatile for all age groups, along with all
the other features that existing solutions like Netflix Party, Facebook Live Party and other applications gives our product an upper edge.

Currently for prototype version, we have planned a web application that makes a screenshot of users desktop every second. 
After this it encodes it as videostream and sent this stream to Wowza-server. 
Wowza is able to restream this stream to any number of users, that can access the stream via flash-player.
